Following resources at the moment to get a handle on full stack development, I don't have much experience in javascript in general, so this will probably take a lot longer than normal to get this done. Hopefully, by the end of going through all the resources, I'll be proficient enough to create something thats practical, but also decently safe and secure. Not sure how much about the security aspect that's in the resource, but hopefully there's something in there about it.
